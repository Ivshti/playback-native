TODO
----
 * make it render on OS X
 * use VLC vout's to render to tint's window
 * automatically re-build webchimera.js for node.js, install libvlc bundle
 * port tint2's Window class (and maybe others) so that they can run outside of tint2 and with upstream node.js distribution

Why is WebChimera.js a submodule
---------
Since creating this involves modifications to WebChimera.js, it's easier to use a submodule to a fork.
